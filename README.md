# Plotly-Challenge
## Overview
This challenge has a partially completed dashboard that needs to be finished. There is a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, one should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 
This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables which are as follows:

- Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
- Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
- Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
- Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
# Horizontal Bar Chart
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

After completing the coding requirements, dashboard will look like the image below when it loads for the first time:

# Bubble Chart
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, a bubble chart is created that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

- The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
- The sample_values as the y-axis values.
- The sample_values as the marker size.
- The otu_ids as the marker colors.
- The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

# Gauge Chart
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, a gauge chart is created that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

After completing all the coding requirements, dashboard will look like this image when it loads for the first time, with the bar chart created in Deliverable 1, the bubble chart created in Deliverable 2, and the gauge chart:
